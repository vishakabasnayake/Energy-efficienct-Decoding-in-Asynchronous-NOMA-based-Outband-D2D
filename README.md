# Energy-efficiency-optimization-in-asynchronous-NOMA-successive-interference-cancellation-SIC

Mobile devices in out-of-coverage areas have limited energy capacities and thus it is important to propose energy-efficient methods for mobile device signal processing. Out-band device-to-device (D2D) communications allow users to directly communicate using randomly allocated resources and without direct support from the network infrastructure. In a resource-limited scenario, two or more devices can get allocated the same resource, which results in devices communicating using the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme. Moreover, in such a scenario the lack of perfect synchronization among user communications is a significant challenge in decoding the received data reliably. Hence, it is important to study the asynchronous transmissions which can occur in NOMA in the outband D2D. Moreover, in this work, energy efficiency (EE) optimization for an asynchronous NOMA system under SIC decoding is considered.

An optimization algorithm for the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding scheme in asynchronous transmission is designed. Such an algorithm is modeled to maximize the number of symbols decoded under energy threshold constraints of SIC decoding. The considered optimization problem is computationally challenging due to the coupled constraints in continuous and binary variables. In order to tackle this problem, a dual Lagrangian objective function employed to optimize the number of user data decoded per iteration in SIC. Numerical results validate the significance of the proposed sequential T-SIC scheme compare to conventional T-SIC in terms of EE, computational complexity and SIC decoding delay.
